<h1>About Lab 2</h1>
<p>In this lab, I learned how to create and use links to connect web pages together and allow users to navigate between different parts of a website. I also learned how to build tables to organize and display information in a structured way using rows, columns, and header cells. In addition, I learned about accessibility and why it is important to design websites that everyone can use, including using proper HTML elements, adding scope to table headers, and making sure links and content are clear and easy to understand for all users.</p>
